# Gates of Hell: Ostfront Conquest Enemy Research Unpredictability Manipulator (CERUM)

CERUM was born out of a desire for the enemy AI in conquest to have a research path more on par with the player, and preferably one that is unpredictable from campaign to campaign.

Due to the nature of the AI research in conquest mode, this requires generating a new mod file to alter the AI research path. I've created this tool to make it easy to generate a new AI research path for a given conquest campaign.

You should only replace this mod when starting a new campaign. Do not attempt to replace your mod in the middle of a campaign.

## How do I use it?

Visit https://anonanimal.github.io/goh-tools/ to interact with the tool. Read the instructions at the bottom of that page. If you run into any issues with the tool or the mods it generates, please open an issue  on the project GitHub (https://github.com/Anonanimal/goh-tools/issues).

Once you've downloaded the mod from the tool, make sure to place it in your mods folder and activate it in game.
